I [just released LosslessCut](./2020-04-01-losslesscut-now-on-the-mac-app-store-and-microsoft-store.md) to stores on three different platforms Windows, Mac and Linux: Mac App Store, Microsoft Store, Snapcraft. I want to share the process and the hurdles I went through in this article.

<!--truncate-->

**Note: [Moved here](/docs/github/electron-ci).**

I believe the key to any well-maintained project is to have an automated release pipeline, or else it will be a hassle every time one wants to do bug fixes and improvements. I have now taken some time to set up automated build and signing for Mac OS (notarization) as well as release to the Mac App Store, Microsoft Store and Snapcraft. I have used many CI systems but I find that the new Github Actions are very fast and feature rich, and with its reusable action ecosystem it is quite easy to use. And all the setup and configuration is of course available open source for anyone to see [here](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml). See the actions in action(heh) [here](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/actions), as a free reference for anyone else needing to set up an automated build and release process of their Electron app.

Building and releasing for big stores like Microsoft and Mac App Store can be a true nightmare that can take weeks to set up, however thanks to awesome projects like `electron-builder` and `action-electron-builder`, it is not really that bad and only took me a few days to setup, and once setup the code is automatically built and ready to be released. The only recurring task is regenerating Apple certificates and provisioning profiles once per year.

The things that I had the most trouble with when setting up were:

## Correct metadata

Getting all the correct metadata in place was mostly handled by `electron-builder` and can be seen in [package.json](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/blob/master/package.json), but some things did not give an error until a human looked at it during the review process.

## Hardened runtime

In `package.json`, `hardenedRuntime` needs to be set to `true` for the `mac` platform, because notarized apps need to be hardened.

However for Mac App Store signed apps `mas`, it **needs to be set to `false`**.

## Microsoft Store

### Microsoft Store review

Reviewers complained about:

- Screenshot did not have Windows style border, but Mac style. Easy fix.
- Missing icons in `appx` XML config. Need to be configured correctly in `package.json`: https://www.electron.build/configuration/appx#appx-assets

## Mac App Store

### The entitlements files

These files need to contain the correct entitlements in order to be able to open files and directories on the filesystem, as well as inherit these rights to the `ffmpeg` process. Without any entitlements, the app is not allowed to read/write files.

* [entitlements.mas.plist](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/blob/master/entitlements.mas.plist)
* [entitlements.mas.inherit.plist](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/blob/master/entitlements.mas.inherit.plist)
* [entitlements.mas.loginhelper.plist](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/blob/master/entitlements.mas.loginhelper.plist)

One thing I struggled a bit with is that Mac Store Apps **need to have opened a file using the system open dialog** before the app can read or write. In order to write to a directory, like LosslessCut does, I need to first present the user with an Open dialog to select which directory to output to. This seems to be a requirement in order for apps not to just write to any folder on the system.

### App Icon

Icon needs to be `.icns` format and have 512 and 1024 sizes in it

### Touch Bar API

Reviewers complained about what I believe is Electron using the Touch Bar API, but my app does not use it:
>  "If your app does not integrate Touch Bar functionality, please indicate this information in the Review Notes section for each version of your app in iTunes Connect when submitting for review"

So need to make sure to write this in Review notes for every release.

### ffmpeg private API usage

Getting ffmpeg through App Store review is a bit tricky. The [ffmpeg static build](https://github.com/zimbatm/ffmpeg-static) that I originally used has a lot of stuff built into them. One thing that App Store review complained about is a call to `_SecIdentityCreate` which I traced back to [this file](http://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/tls__securetransport_8c_source.html). But it could be disabled by the [\--disable-securetransport option](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/configure#L318). So I needed to build a custom ffmpeg without this flag.

```bash
nm ffmpeg | grep SecIdentityCreate
nm ffprobe | grep SecIdentityCreate
```

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47629110/ffmpeg-gets-aborted-in-an-electron-sandboxed-application
* https://github.com/AndrewSchenk/App-Scanner

Other than that, with Electron 8, there was no other private API usages complained about.

### Building a signable ffmpeg without dynamic links

When building ffmpeg on Mac OS, even with all options indicating it should include everything as static, it will still link `.dylib` files dynamically.

```bash
otool -L ffmpeg | grep /usr/local
```

I solved this by only building my own ffmpeg using GitHub Actions and stripping away all external dependencies like codecs (because we are only doing muxing operations which only requires ffmpeg core functionality.)

### Building ffmpeg to support older Mac OS versions

On the first try I got an error report on older Mac OS X (10.13):

```
Command was killed with SIGABRT (Aborted): ffprobe -of json -show_format -i vid.mp4
dyld: lazy symbol binding failed: Symbol not found: ____chkstk_darwin
Referenced from: ffprobe (which was built for Mac OS X 10.15)
Expected in: /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib
```

This can be verified by running `nm ffprobe | grep ____chkstk_darwin`

In order to fix this I had to add `-mmacosx-version-min=10.10` to `--extra-clfags` and `--extra-ldflags`

Then rebuild and verify that the `____chkstk_darwin` symbol reference is gone.

### Certificate creation/renewal

For each certificate to be created, you need to create a CSR: Keychain Access, Menu -> Certificate assistant -> Request a certificate from a CA. Enter email. "Saved to disk".

Go to [certificates](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list). See which certificates that are about to expire soon - only generate those.

For notarized only apps (non-App Store), you only need to create this certificate:
- `Developer ID Application`

For Mac App Store and Notarized apps create the following certs:
- `Developer ID Installer` (not needed if already long expiry)
- `Developer ID Application` (not needed if already long expiry)
- `Mac Installer Distribution`
- `Mac App Distribution`
- `Mac Development`

If you want to build `mas-dev` locally, also create:
- `Apple Development`

Then dowload them and drag drop into Keychain Access ("Login" keychain). You may then safely delete the downloaded `.cer` files.

Now regenerate [provisioning profile(s)](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles/list). For **each of** the "App Store" and "Developement" Provisioning Profiles:
- Open the provisioning profile
- Edit
- (For the Development profile only) check all Certificates and Devices, and select the device you registered earlier.
- (For the App Store profile only) check the newly generated "Mac App Distribution" certificate's radio box
- Then Save and Download

For the App Store provisioning profile, run:
```bash
base64 < LosslessCut_Mac_App_Store_provisioning_profile.provisionprofile | pbcopy
```

...then paste the clipboard contents to replace the env variable in the GitHub project [`PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64`](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/settings/secrets/actions/PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64).

For the Development profile, add the new profile into the project folder (don't check it into git.)

In Keychain Access go to Login keychain -> My Certificates

For Mac App Store + Notarized apps, select the following certificates (if duplicates, choose the one with the longest expiry):
- `Developer ID Application: *`
- `Developer ID Installer: *`
- `3rd Party Mac Developer Installer: *`
- `3rd Party Mac Developer Application: *`

If notarized build only (no Mac App Store), select:
- `Developer ID Application: *`

Then right click and export to `Certificates.p12` with a strong random password, note the password.

In the GitHub project replace:
- [`MAC_CERTS_PASSWORD`](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/settings/secrets/actions/MAC_CERTS_PASSWORD) with the generated password.
- [`MAC_CERTS`](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/settings/secrets/actions/MAC_CERTS) to the output of this command: `base64 -i Certificates.p12 -o -`

### Testing mas builds locally

Note that the Electron `mas` build can no longer be run locally on a dev Mac. For running MAS app locally, we need to create a separate provisioning profile for development, with the **Developer Mac's UDID** and use `mas-dev` with that profile. See [this issue](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/1196#issuecomment-310638965).

Under [Devices](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/devices/list), make sure that the your development Mac's device UDID is registered. Be sure to use the **Provisioning UDID**, *not the Hardware UUID* [More information about registering device](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/distributing-your-app-to-registered-devices).
