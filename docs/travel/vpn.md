## Surfshark subscription renewal scam

The price that you see on surfshark.com is a very good deal $1.99/mo. You sign up for 2+ years and it's all good - until the renewal comes 2 years later. **Boom!** They now charge you $84.76 for a 12 month renewal. That's more than 7$/mo! Frustrated, you go back to surfshark.com and you see the price they are offering new customers is $1.99/mo for 24 months with an additional 3 months free - that's 1.77$/mo! But Surfshark "values" their existing customers by hiking their price by nearly +200% on renewal! If this is not scammy practice, I don't know what is. The lesson is: **If you buy Surfshark VPN, immediately cancel the subscription auto-renewal**. They will try to lure you back with a better price, but still not as good as the new customer price. So go ahead and cancel. Then, once it expires 2 years later, you can get the good "new customer" price once again, as the good customer you are. And please tell Surfshark that they should value their existing customers more.

Note: I heard this also happens with NordVPN (not tested). But no surprising considering they're the same company (same owner).
