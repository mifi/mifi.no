# Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs)

[PLBs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_position-indicating_radiobeacon) are personal devices that can be used to receiving emergency help when in distress out in the wilderness or out at sea. They are being sold by various companies at a steep price, compared to the cost of the components they use. They usually have a non-rechargeable battery that typically lasts for 10 years, but the PLB manufacturers usually recommend changing them after 5-6 years. Once expired, the battery has to be replaced, typically only by the same company that sold the device - at a price almost as high as the purchase price of the PLB. And because the battery pack is often built in a proprietary way, it's hard to find these batteries for sale anywhere in order to replace them ourselves.

## Registration / permit

Most countries require a registration of your device's unique ID.

### DIY Battery replacement

I bought a second hand FastFind 220 from Finn.no with a battery that had expired in 2021 (produced in 2014). Note that in 2025, I tested the battery and it shows 3 bars (FULL). But I would still like to replace it to be on the safe side.

Info:

- Uses 2 spearate battery packs
- Each pack with 2 Lithium Manganese Dioxide battery cells, with spot welded tabs and a proprietary plug that I cannot find anywhere.
- Nominal voltage: 3 * 2 = 6V each.
- Total voltage of the two packs: 12V.

**Tip!** I replaced the 3 flimsy phillips screws on top with torx screws, and I keep a small torx screwdriver with my PLB in case it needs to be opened in the field. I keep my old batteries as a backup so that worst case they can be switched in the field. This gives a little extra security.

### Where to buy new battery

Hard to find these batteries, but a tip: [Search for "MRG210FM"](https://www.google.com/search?q=MRG210FM).

### Photos

Battery packs were made in 2014 by a company that seems to no longer exist.

After removing the shrinkwrap we see that they are regular Varta CR123A / CR17345 Lithium Manganese Dioxide (Li-MnO2) batteries:

Batteries have welded tabs:
