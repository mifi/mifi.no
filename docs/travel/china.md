# China travel

## Must have apps

## WeChat Pay / Weixin Pay / 微信支付

This app is essential, especially for paying for almost anything. You pay by either presenting your WeChat "send payment" QR code for the vendor to scan, or by you scanning the vendor's QR code with your WeChat app (more common for amateur vendors or small shops).

In the past it was very hard for tourists to pay for services in China, but recently China has opened up for foreigners to use the WeChat Pay service (which is used virtually everywhere). You can link a credit/debit card like Visa/MasterCard and then pay using it in China. Some reports that the card has to be added from outside China (not sure if VPN from China works)

### 200CNY no-fee limit

If you transfer 200CNY or less per transaction, the transaction will not incur any fees from WeChat. If not, a 3% fee is added to the amount. A common workaround to get a free payment above 200CNY is to ask the vendor to split the payment into <=200CNY transactions. This works, but note that when I transferred 3 payments of 200 to a Chinese person, the 4th transaction got rejected.

### AliPay

Can also be used for payments.

Better than WeChat in that it is more foreigner-focused - many mini-apps are translated to English. There's a global "translate to English" function built into the UI. Popular mini apps include public transport tickets (train, metro, bus), and for ordering take-away.

### Apple Maps

Apple's Maps app is notoriously bad in the western world, but in China it's one of the best! They import data from Chinese sources/APIs and shows almost every shop and restaurant along with reviews. Maps are not obfuscated like Google Maps. It even has multi-level mall maps!

### Google Maps

Not so popular in China but sometimes it can be useful to find western-perspective reviews of certain attractions. Maps are [obfuscated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China) (meaning satellite data will be off by a few hundred meters).

### [Organic Maps](https://organicmaps.app/)

Offline Open Street Maps. This is useful in every country, also China (but to a lessess extent due to lacking quality of maps).

### Baidu Maps

Cannot be downloaded by foreigners (of many countries).

### Apple Translate

Can download translations offline, allowing you to translate text, camera/image and voice without an internet connection (although most of China does have good internet connection!)

### VPN / connection with the outside world

See [censorship](censorship.md).

### [Wise](https://wise.prf.hn/click/camref:1100l457Yb) [^1]

Invaluable for international travel / payments.

### [Trip.com](https://www.trip.com/t/GW6LAnzQTX1) [^1]

One of the best apps to book hotels and attractions in China for foreigners. Singapore based.

### Skype

Make international calls (almost) for free. **Update**: Skype is now defunct.

### Ride hailing

DiDi: Can be hard to download / use for foreigners, but it can also be found as a mini-app inside AliPay.

## Power banks

Surprising to many is that China is one of few (the only?) countries in the world that doesn't allow powerbanks on **planes** and **trains**, unless the powerbank has a CCC-marking on it (I jokingly call it Chinese Communist Charger ☭🙊). So make sure to get a power bank with a CCC-marking (they can be bought in China). If your powerbank doesn't have this marking, you have to leave it at home! Or try to hide it in your luggage and hope for the best, or put a CCC-sticker on it. 😇
