# Drones

## Drones in Europe (EU/EAA drone classes)

**TLDR:** Don't buy a new DJI Mini or other <250g drone if you want to higher than 120m altitude in Europe because they will be hard limited to 120m. If you have an old drone, don't firmware upgrade it.

As of Jan 1st 2024 drone manufacturers must classify all drones C0 to C6 (EU/EEA/UK requirement).

### Class C0 <250g

Examples: All DJI Mini drones.

- <250g drones can be C0
- C0 drones can be flown legally without registration/certification in EU/EEA
- Manufacturers have to limit C0 drones (in software) to max 120m above the takeoff altitude
- DJI drones older than Jan 1st 2024 have a limit of 500m (until firmware upgraded).

### Other drone classes (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6)

They need certification to fly legally but are not bound by this 120m software limit.

## Remote ID

C1, C2, C3 drones must broadcast Remote ID. This differs between Europe and US.

### Drone operator ID (Europe)

In Europe, Remote ID will also broadcast operator ID, which must be entered before flying a Remote ID equipped drone (not sure if this is enforced in the drone or a legal requirement for the pilot).

## Drones in China

From Jan 1st 2024, all drones (even <250g, e.g. DJI Mini) need to be registered using a Chinese phone number. Either use a Chinese friend's number or get a SIM with a number. Registration is free. Note that after registering, I did not have to enter any ID into the Drone's UI or scan any QR code in order for the drone to work. But I had also not upgraded the drone to the latest firmware.

Go to https://uom.caac.gov.cn website, or find the UOM app (Doesn't work on iOS unless Chinese).

Note: Needs face scan (using WeChat) during registration AND for every login.

### Drones in Tibet

Drones are allowed in tibet. Same rules as in China (because Tibet is now owned by China). Not allowed to fly in large cities like Lhasa. Some places have no-drone signs, such as many (but not all) tourist attractions.

#### Mount Everest Base Camp

It's possible to fly a drone at the (tourist) base camp but you should go to the very end (near the cliff towards the river facing Mount Everest) and don't fly near people. There are surveillance cameras there, but no guards. Chinese tourists seem to be flying all the time. There are *no* no-drone signs and the DJI Fly app doesn’t warn agains flying.

## DJI drone hacks

### [No Limit Drones](https://nolimitdronez.com/)

Remove strictions from DJI drones. Only seems to work on older drones.
